# Create-Conda-Environment
Based upon https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/hpc/The-Best-Way-to-Install-TensorFlow-with-GPU-Support-on-Windows-10-Without-Installing-CUDA-1187/#vscode and idea from https://gist.github.com/jeffgreenca/28e0fe58644b8af48f97a3e18fe08302

This script serves as a self-reminder of how to install a new Conda environment with TF/Keras etc behind a company firewall.
I found myself digging the same information everytime so this will help me, and hopefully others.
